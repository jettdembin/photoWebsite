# Hello Photo, API

This website demonstrates the aquisition of data through an APi provided by the website Pexels.com. It also demonstrates use of boostrap.

Feel free to search any scenery that comes to mind, and the application will return professional photoes.

While the application does have two navigation bars, it will not take the user to any pages, as it is only intended for visual asthetic.

The website is functional on mobile.
