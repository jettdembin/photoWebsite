# Hello Photo, API

This is a website created through the API provided by the website Pexels.com

It is not intended for mobile use at this time and it functions purely to demonstrate knowledge of aquiring data through an API.

Feel free to search any scenery that comes to mind, and the application will return professional photoes.

While the application does have a navigation bar, it will not take the user to any pages, as it is only intended for visual asthetic.
