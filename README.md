# Hello Photo, API

This website demonstrates the aquisition of data through an API provided by the website Pexels.com. It also demonstrates the use of Bootstrap.

Feel free to search any scenery that comes to mind, and the application will return professional photos related to the search.

While the application does have two navigation bars, it will not direct the user to any pages, as it is only intended for the visual asthetic at this moment in time.
